In this project, I dive into a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows to explore and visualize the data. Using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, I create graphs and charts to uncover patterns and trends in the content available on Netflix. This analysis looks at things like the distribution of genres, release years, and other interesting features of the Netflix library. Itâ€™s a fun way to understand what kind of content Netflix offers.
